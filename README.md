# YREC-Wrappers
Wrappers, helpful codes, and additional machinery to interface with YREC in languages such as Python. Presented here as individual scripts to copy/paste and/or download. Compatible with command line and Jupyter/Spyder, and other such programs. We provide the '''modelgrid_tools''' folder for the primary mode of interacting with the grid. The '''modelgrid_tools_legacy''' is the precursor to the modelgrid_tools code, and is also applicable. The '''_legacy''' tools are more Jupyter Notebook (or another Python interface/environment) focused, whereas the primary '''_tools''' are a combination of an app/web compiler for Python and command line prompts. The main tools folder also provides compatibility with '''hypergator''' and '''slurm'''. 

## modelgrid_tools:
Contains guidelines and tools to create a grid of models in YREC. See the readme.md file in the folder for more details. This also contains update_nml.py, which allows the user to change several namelist parameters for multiple nml files at once.

## Tracker:
Easy tool for loading '''.track''' files (the primary output of YREC) into modern data analysis packages such as Pandas. Needed for '''load_yrec_tracks.py'''

## load_yrec_tracks: 
Allows for the loading of YREC tracks in from the outputs generated by yrec_runner or from command-line run YREC outputs. The user may need to update headers/column names as these vary depending on the YREC version utilized. 

## read_output_files:
Allows the user to read individual .store, .last, and .track YREC output files into Pandas dataframes without
any additional processing of the output files.
