## Overview

This repository contains Python tools for preparing, updating, and managing YREC (Yale Rotating Stellar Evolution Code) model grids. These scripts help you:

- Update YREC namelist files with custom parameters.
- Generate grids of stellar models over mass and metallicity ([Fe/H]).
- Load and manipulate YREC model tracks for analysis.
- Run YREC in batch mode for multiple models efficiently.

These tools are ideal for research-level stellar modeling, especially when creating large grids or testing multiple physical assumptions.
